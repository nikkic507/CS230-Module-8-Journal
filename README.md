# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client wanted to develop a game that is web-based that serves multiple platforms. The game will be based on a game the they currently have available as an android app called Draw It or Lose It. The software requirements include the game having the ability to have one or more teams involved, and each team will have multiple players assigned to it. The software needs to check for unique game and team names (iterator design pattern) and have only one instance of the game existing in memory at any given time, we do this by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player (singleton design pattern). 

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think what I did particularly well in developing this documentation is the amount of research I did to get a complete understanding of the different operating systems. This allowed for informed decisions and a complete overview of what needed to be done to meet The Gaming Room's requirements and requests. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The process of working through a design document helped me develop the code by narrowing down what design pattern we needed to use to accomplish what the client was asking for such as the iterator design pattern, and the singleton design pattern. It also helped keep what the requirements were straight forward and could be used as a guide while building the code. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the table of information for the development requirements for Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile Devices. I would it improve it by adding more information for the client. I would have added more examples of resources that are made available by each os.  

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
My interpretaion of the user's needs was they needed unique team, and player names. The app needed to be easy and fun to use for the users. It is important to consider the user's need when designing software because if it is too difficult, hard to access, or isn't entertaining (in this case) then the users will no longer use the app and the client will lose business and profits. 

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The approach I took designing the software was trying to give the client exactly what they required for their future expansion and useability I narrowed down what design pattern would work best for the clients needs and implemented it in my application design. I used the software design document to help keep me on track for what the client needed. I would use the same technique and strategy in the future because it helped keep me focused and it seemed to satisfy my clients needs.
